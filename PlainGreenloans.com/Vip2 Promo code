PayDay Loans are a growing trend in this present day economy, and Oh how evil they are. The state in which I reside allows Payday Lenders to register and operate legally. Not all States do, but in my State, there are as many Payday Loan stores in any given city as there are StarBucks or McDonalds. It is a crying shame because they do a very thriving business at the expense of people like me, the consumer.

Here is an eye opener for anyone who has not had a Payday Loan, the inner workings that lead to a cycle of debt. The maximum limit for a Payday loan differs from state to state as does the fees/percentage rate that can be charged. But here, where I reside, you can go to one lender and get the limit in my state, a loan of $1,000. This is a pay day loan, a draw against your next check. Keep that in mind, because you can then go to the next lender three doors down, and get another max loan of $1,000! Against that very same pay check! Yep, that is right. These stores have license to lend the max amount without checking your credit and on your good word alone that you can pay them back. I'm sure you can imagine what a mess this could turn out to be. An average consumer can pretty much get a draw way over and beyond what they actually bring home in their net pay. Hey, it really happens too. Sadly enough.
